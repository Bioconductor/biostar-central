## original beta announcement.

Hello!

This is a message to announce the beta test for our new support site.
We hope to replace the regular Bioconductor mailing list with this
site soon and we have imported the past 11+ years of mailing list
discussion into this new site.  If you would like to help us test it
out you can do that by logging in here:

https://support.bioconductor.org

For those of you who have posted to the bioconductor mailing list
before, you will probably want to recover your well earned reputation
from previous posts and answers.  To do that you will need to scroll
to the bottom of the log in page and click the link that says 'Forgot
Password?'.  This should get you started with your mailing list email
address which will already be linked to your previous posts.

And if you have never posted, then you can start a new account from
that same page.

As you explore the beta, you may come across things that you would
like to see changed or that you feel are not working right.  This site
is based on a fork of Biostars, and we ask that you please post such
questions to our github repository for this:

https://github.com/Bioconductor/support.bioconductor.org/issues

We aspire to switch over to this new site in early September, but we are
leaving the schedule flexible depending on how well the beta site
works.  Also: please note that posts made to the new site during the
beta will dissappear after the test period.  We want you to help us
test it, but this is not the live deployment phase quite yet.

I expect there will probably be some other questions about this big
transition. So please ask them as needed and we will try to answer
them the best we can.

## email to announce the end of the beta:

Hello,

Thank you to those of you who have participated in the Beta for our
new support site.  The beta period is now over, and we are getting
ready for a formal launch of the site during the week of September
15th.

At that time the regular Bioconductor mailing list will stop being
used.  If you try to use that mailing list after the final support
site has gone live, you will instead get a reply telling you that the
mailing list is no longer in service and directing you to post to the
new site.

## email to inform users that they should not use the email list:

Hi!  I see that you are trying to use the bioconductor mailing list.
This mailing list is now retired in order to provide better support
for the community at the following site:

https://support.bioconductor.org

Please feel free to go there and make use of this site right away.  If
you had posted to this list before it was closed, then you will be
able to reclaim your identity by scrolling to the bottom of the log in
page and click the link that says 'Forgot Password?'.  Otherwise you
can simply create a new account and log in to the site.

mailing list is being retired.  So you will not be able to post
questions to it any longer.  Instead, you can make use of the site by
going to the following link:

https://support.bioconductor.org

For those of you who have posted to the bioconductor mailing list

address which will already be linked to your previous posts.

And if you have never posted, then you can start a new account from
that same page.

For those of you who have posted under different names at different
times, you may want to look at our support sites new FAQ so that you
can get your records merged together.  You can read our new support
site FAQ here:

https://support.bioconductor.org/info/faq/

The FAQ also contains other helpful information about how to get the
most out of the new site.  So feel free to give it a look.
