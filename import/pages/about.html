<h3>About Bioconductor and Biostar</h3>

<p>This site is the home of the <a href="http://www.bioconductor.org">Bioconductor</a> mailing list.  More details about the Bioconductor project can be found <a href="http://www.bioconductor.org/about/">here</a>.</p>

<p>This site&#39;s focus is&nbsp;<strong>bioinformatics</strong>,&nbsp;<strong>computational genomics</strong>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<strong>biological
    data analysis</strong>.</p>

<p>No question is too trivial or too &quot;newbie&quot;.</p>

<p>But we do recommend that you make use of the search services to see if your question has already been asked (perhaps even answered!) before you ask.</p>

<p>And we also <strong>strongly</strong> recommend that you look at our <a href="http://www.bioconductor.org/help/mailing-list/posting-guide/">posting guide</a>.  The most important step you can take to making sure that your questions get answered is to provide enough information so that they are answerable.</p>

<p>The software that this site runs on is called <a href="https://www.biostars.org/">Biostar</a>.  Biostar and Bioconductor are both separate open source projects.  And we are grateful that the Biostar software has been kept open source so that we can make use of its capabilities here.</p>
