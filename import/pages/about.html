<h3>About Bioconductor and Biostar</h3>

<p>This site is the home of the <a href="http://www.bioconductor.org">Bioconductor</a> mailing list.  More details about the Bioconductor project can be found <a href="http://www.bioconductor.org/about/">here</a>.</p>

<p>This site&#39;s focus is&nbsp;<strong>bioinformatics</strong>,&nbsp;<strong>computational genomics</strong>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<strong>biological
    data analysis</strong>.</p>

<p>No question is too trivial or too &quot;newbie&quot;.</p>

<p>Before you post, we recommend that you make use of the search services to see if your question has been answered before. If you should discover that your question has not been answered before, we strongly recommend that you look at our <a href="http://www.bioconductor.org/help/mailing-list/posting-guide/">posting guide</a> to ensure that your question can be answered.</p>

<p>The software that this site runs on is called <a href="https://www.biostars.org/">Biostar</a>.  Biostar and Bioconductor are both separate open source projects.  And we are grateful that the Biostar software has been kept open source so that we can make use of its capabilities here.</p>
