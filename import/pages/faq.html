<h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2><h3>Contact</h3><p>Those of us who maintain this site read the posts that are made here.  So users who wish to contact us are encouraged to post to this mailing list.</p><h3>Moderation guidelines</h3><p>Users posting content that does not belong to the site will be notified and required to edit their content. Users may    post commercially motivated posts to the Forum section as long as the topic aligns with the main focus of this site.    Users posting obvious spam will be immediately suspended.</p><h3>User reputation</h3><p>The number next to a user&#39;s name is the sum of upvotes and accepted answers that user has collected.</p><h3>Becoming a moderator</h3><p>Active users above a certain reputation threshold are periodically promoted to moderators. You may also explicitly    ask    for moderation rights or suggest good candidates on the newsgroup. Inactive users that do not visit the site for    extended periods of time may lose their moderation rights.</p><h3>Merging multiple acccounts</h3><p>So perhaps you have been using the Bioconductor mailing list for a long time and unfortunately you have been using  multiple aliases to do that.  And now you would like to consolidate things so that you can get credit for actually just being one person.  What should you do?  Well 1st of all you should get set up with the account that you normally use.  If you have not logged in before this may mean going straight to password recovery. Then once you can log in, you will want to click on your name and then go to the little blue button that is called 'Social Login'.  Here you should be able to link in other accounts like gmail or facebook. </p><h3>Use of tags</h3><p>This site offers two ways to track posts when they use certain tags. You can add the tags that you want tracked into your user profile. 'My Tags' will put posts that match your tagging criteria into a special tab that you can check whenever you log in.  And 'Watched Tags" should actually email you whenever someone posts using a tag that you are interested in. </p>
