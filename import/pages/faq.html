<h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2><h3>How do I contact you?</h3><p>Those of us who maintain this site read the posts that are madehere.  So users who wish to contact us are encouraged to post to thissite.</p><h3>How do I write good posts?</h3><p>One of the biggest things that new users struggle with is how toask questions in a way that allows people to answer them.  So if youare unfamiliar please have a look atthe <a href="http://www.bioconductor.org/help/mailing-list/posting-guide/">postingguide</a> for some great advice.</p><h3>How do I put images into my posts?</h3><p>You can also put images and plots into your posts.  All you need todo is create (or login to) a free account with http://imgur.com andupload any images or plots that you want to share.  Then you can enterthe imgur generated 'Direct Link' url into the 'URL' location that isavailable when you click on the 'image' button in the text editor.The plot will be imbedded right into your post.</p><h3>How can I keep track of topics that interest me?</h3><p>This site offers two ways to track posts when they use certaintags. You can add the tags that you want tracked into your userprofile. 'My Tags' will put posts that match your tagging criteriainto a special tab that you can check whenever you log in.  And'Watched Tags" should actually email you whenever someone posts usinga tag that you are interested in. </p><h3>How do I merge multiple previous acccounts?</h3><p>So perhaps you have been using the Bioconductor mailing list for along time and during that time you have been using multiple differentaliases.  And now you would like to consolidate things so that you canget credit for actually being only one person.  What should you do?Well 1st of all you should get set up with the account that younormally use.  If you have not logged in before this may mean goingstraight to password recovery.</p> <p>Once you can log in, you will want to click on your name andthen go to the little blue button that is called 'Social Login'.  Hereyou should be able to link in other social accounts that you may haveused before (such as gmail) to your primary account email.</p><p>If it turns out that your previous aliases are not listed asoptional social logins (as may happen if they were associated withdifferent academic institutions) then you will need to email usat <a href="mailto:webmaster@bioconductor.org">webmaster@bioconductor.org</a>and send us a file.  This file needs to contain a single line thatlooks like this: email1 email2 email3 etc.  Essentially, this fileshould contain one email for each account you wish to merge (separatedby whitespace). And the very first email that it lists must be the onethat you want to regularly use as your primary account for thissite.</p><h3>What if I find a bug with the support site?</h3><p>No site is perfect and you may come across things that you feel arenot working as they should be.  This site is based on a fork ofBiostars so we have the power to correct many problems as they arediscovered.  If you find a problem with this website, we ask that youplease post such questions to our github repository forit <a href="https://github.com/Bioconductor/support.bioconductor.org/issues">here</a>.</p><h3>What about offensive content?</h3><p>Users posting content that does not belong to the site will benotified and required to edit their content. Users may post jobpostings to the 'Jobs' section as long as the topic aligns with themain focus of this site.  Users posting obvious spam will beimmediately suspended.</p><h3>User reputation</h3><p>The number next to a user&#39;s name is the sum of upvotes andaccepted answers that user has collected.  Upvotes boost yourreputation on the site.</p><h3>Becoming a moderator</h3><p>Active users above a certain reputation threshold may beperiodically promoted to moderators. You may explicitly ask formoderation rights or suggest good candidates on the newsgroup and wewill weigh these requests carefully. Inactive users that do not visitthe site for extended periods of time may lose their moderationrights.</p>
